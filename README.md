# OWTPhotoChecklist

This is just a quick little helper app I'm putting together really quick.  I'm working on an Orlando Walking Tours app with Code for Orlando.  One thing we don't have yet are pictures of all the historic locations.  I was going to drive down there and take pictures of the locations for the app when I realized that I didn't have a good way to find all the locations and then track which locations I had visited already.  So, that's why I'm writing this app. :)
